When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with collaborators or you want a backup of your data in case your computer crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that if someone updates master on github it, doesn't automatically alter your local files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones on github. Clones are when you duplicate a repository on your computer or from another computer onto
your computer. Branches are when you deviate from you code within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
then you can work offline and compare the remote with your local files and merge if needed

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without it I'd probably send files via email. Or at least the changes. It would be hard to keep all copies
updated with eachother and very hard to work on a project with multiple people or at the same time as others.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
THis is a hard question for me to answer. Not sure really. It seems like branchs greatly complicate things. but I suppose anytime you 
want to add something that might not be permanent, a branch seems like a good option.
