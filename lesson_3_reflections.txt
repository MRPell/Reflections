When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with collaborators or you want a backup of your data in case your computer crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that if someone updates master on github it, doesn't automatically alter your local files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones on github. Clones are when you duplicate a repository on your computer or from another computer onto
your computer. Branches are when you deviate from you code within a repository.
